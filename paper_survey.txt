Face Recognition Algorithms Surpass Humans Matching Faces Over Changes in Illumination
O'Toole, A.J.; Phillips, P.J.; Fang Jiang; Ayyad, J.; Penard, N.; Abdi, H.; 
	Not doing recognition! Ran on FRGC data set. Had to decide if pairs of passport-type photos were of the same person or not.  Again kept only white people.  Only compared images of the same sex, so no gender recognition involved.

On the Dimensionality of Face Space
Meytlis, M.; Sirovich, L.; 
	Tries to experimentally estimate an upper bound on the number of dimensions our brains use to model faces for recognition.  Experiment deliberately used all white people under uniform illumination.  If eigenspace is used, they claim 200-300 dimensions.  Not really relevant to us; we aren't pushing dimension reduction of the face images.

Appearance Characterization of Linear Lambertian Objects, Generalized Photometric Stereo, and Illumination-Invariant Face Recognition
Zhou, S.K.; Aggarwal, G.; Chellappa, R.; Jacobs, D.W.; 
	Factorizes a gallery of training images from multiple people to try to learn something about normals of faces as a class.  Claims to be able to use a training set with one illumination, gallery set with another illumination, and probe set with a third illumination.  Assumes a single light source (extended to 2-3 light sources).  Uses face symmetry, estimates of shadows and specularities to deal with non-linearity.  Does not perform alignment.  Some variants discussed include images rendered from 3D models.  Claims almost perfect scores on original PIE.

Total variation models for variable lighting face recognition
Chen, T.; Wotao Yin; Xiang Sean Zhou; Comaniciu, D.; Huang, T.S.;
	Tries to remove facial features from a single image that are illumination invariant.  Assumes that illumination dependent component has Low Total Variation.  Finds illumination image that minimizes weighted sum of TV and L1 difference with log of the original image.  Works at multiple scales.

Eigenfeature Regularization and Extraction in Face Recognition
Xudong Jiang; Mandal, B.; Kot, A.; 
	Tries to learn a discriminative dictionary, argues against initial dimensionality reduction on the basis of lost discriminative information, saves dimensionality reduction for last.  Clobbers illumination cone structure by subtracting off image means in the scatter matrices.  Performs several questionably motivated space decompositions.  Uses practically no prior information that is even motivated by vision, let alone faces.

Discriminative Face Alignment
Xiaoming Liu; 
	Treats the alignment problem as a two-class classifier, "aligned" and "non-aligned" relative to presumably hand-picked ground truth.  Uses boosting over multiple Haar-like feature choices.  Assumes you want to learn and align to a generic (non-person specific) model.  Score from combined classifier is used as a distance metric, and optimized by perturbing test image.  The weak classifier parameters are the global model.  Claim robustness to partial occlusion.  Claims to beat active shape and appearance models.  In their language, our alignment is a person-specific Active Appearance Model where the training images of the individual form the model.  

Lucas-Kanade 20 years on: A unifying framework
S. Baker, I. Matthews
IJCV 2004
BIG Overview paper.  Seems like it might contain pretty much all of our ideas within the taxonomy.
Started as a series of 4 tech reports.  Part 1 got turned into a journal paper.
http://www.ri.cmu.edu/research_project_detail.html?project_id=515&menu_id=261
Compared to Lucas-Kanade we...
* Minimize L1 norm of error instead of L2 norm
* (We are NOT using a compositional approach)

Efficient Region Tracking With Parametric Models of Geometry and Illumination
G. D. Hager and P. N. Belhumeur, PAMI 1998
A VERY close competitor.  Basically doing the same thing, but for tracking.  Discusses combining the Jacobian with training examples to simultaneously deal with illumination variation and misalignment.  Minimizes L2 norm, but discusses using reweighted least-squares to achieve robustness.

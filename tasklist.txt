Reviewer 1:

cut down ALM section slightly (?) (Arvind)

cite more references for the projectors (Drew)

In general, reduce the emphasis on disguises and large occlusions in the paper, 
instead phrase more in terms of small occlusions, i.e. hairstyle changes.

***add results with local binary patterns and perhaps ERCF on both our data and FRGC (Zihan)
***add results for our algorithm on FRGC (Zihan)

tone down contribution section? Or just more frequently emphasize our scenario. (John or Yi?)
	It seemed Reviewer 1 was offended at least partly because he felt we over-sold our work 

add more discussion of pros/cons of this system vs. 
	3D systems that can handle more pose variation. (Drew)

Say what we mean by "Strong Coupling between illumination and registration" -> we really mean that when both are present, the problems compound each other. (Drew)

add more references for illumination, cite the ones requested.  Emphasize that we're only claiming novelty for use in face recognition. (Drew)

include sentence from rebuttal clarifying our contributions somewhere:  "We believe
we have demonstrated that using a well-though-out combination of existing ideas
(iterative image alignment, l1-error function, SRC, using projectors for
illumination), one can build a recognition that is conceptually simple, well
motivated, and competitive with state-of-the-art recognition systems for access
control scenarios." (Drew)

Reviewer 2
discuss convergence criteria.  In general discuss motivation for convergence more. (Arvind)

Reviewer 3
***add results for S=1, or in general, either demonstrate necessity of SCI or cite previous results.

streamline introduction. make the overall structure of our system clear earlier in the
paper to avoid confusion.

DONE: 

cut down discussion on illumination (Drew) (search for Basri)

Wants a reference for illumination being linear when you only have scattered light. (Drew)

trim section on gamma (Drew)

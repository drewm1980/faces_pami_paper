TO DO:

streamline introduction more?
cut down ALM section slightly? (Arvind)
discuss convergence more in paper?  I already answered some of the questions in the rebuttal.  At minimum a citation is probably needed.

Add brief description of the version of LBP we implemented (Zihan)
Finalize numbers for LBP on Multi-PIE (Zihan)
Finalize numbers for Algorithm1 on FERET
Finalize numbers for LBP on FERET

create changelist in second document, based on a diff of the old with the new .tex file. (Drew)

---------------DONE: -----------------------------
make the overall structure of our system clear earlier in the
paper to avoid confusion.

add results for S=1, or in general, either demonstrate necessity of SCI or cite previous results. (Zihan)

In general, reduce the emphasis on disguises and large occlusions in the paper, 
instead phrase more in terms of small occlusions, i.e. hairstyle changes.

Say what we mean by "Strong Coupling between illumination and registration" -> we really mean that when both are present, the problems compound each other. (Drew)

include sentence from rebuttal clarifying our contributions somewhere:  "We believe
we have demonstrated that using a well-though-out combination of existing ideas
(iterative image alignment, l1-error function, SRC, using projectors for
illumination), one can build a recognition that is conceptually simple, well
motivated, and competitive with state-of-the-art recognition systems for access
control scenarios." (Drew)

cite more references for the projectors (Drew)
add more references for illumination, cite the ones requested.  Emphasize that we're only claiming novelty for use in face recognition. (Drew)

cut down discussion on illumination (Drew) (search for Basri)

Wants a reference for illumination being linear when you only have scattered light. (Drew)

trim section on gamma (Drew)
